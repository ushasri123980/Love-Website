# Pull Request - XML Validator Implementation

## Overview
This submission includes an XML validator implemented in C++ to check the validity of XML strings based on specified rules.

## Files Included
- `XmlValidator.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the XML validator.
- `README.md`: Provides an explanation of the code and instructions for testing.

## Code Overview
The XML validator employs a stack-based approach to ensure the validity of XML strings according to specific rules:
- Validates matching opening and closing tags.
- Ensures correct nesting of elements within each other.

## Approach
- Implemented a stack to track opening tags encountered and verify matching closing tags.
- The algorithm iterates through the XML string, checking for proper tag sequencing and nested structure.

## Usage
- The main entry point is within the `main()` function of `XmlValidator.cpp`.
- Test cases demonstrating validator functionality are included within `main()`.

## Considerations
- Kept the code simple, avoiding complex XML parsing libraries or regular expressions.
- Validates XML based on tag matching without considering attributes or advanced XML structures.
- Utilized `size_t` for indices to represent non-negative sizes and indices within strings.

## Additional Notes
- Prioritized readability, clarity, and compliance with provided requirements.
- No use of external libraries or prohibited modules (e.g., System.XML).

## Conclusion
This submission provides a basic yet effective XML validator adhering to specified rules. It serves as a foundational solution, allowing for potential enhancements while maintaining a clear and understandable approach for XML validation.

Please don't hesitate to ask for further information or clarification.
